# Online_Examination_project
Online Examination is a project aimed at creating mcq type as well as subjective type questions.
There are various ways of creating question papers like through google forms or by directly sending the question paper through gmails/ whatsapp.
But the main disadvantage is that in sending manually written question papers there are issues of handwriting recognition. Moreover in google forms we can only add questions that contains texts.we cannot add questions containing equations, images, tables etc. To add this things an extra editor needs to be downloaded so to overcome such disadvantages, this project was designed were a ckeditor is integrated in our project were we can create any type of question without any problem.
This is an ongoing project will try to complete soon.

HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT & PHP is used for this project
